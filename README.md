"beat the jam is really good for getting to JB and back. what if we could create congestion graph for any two arbitary places?"

Given a route between two locations commutable by car/bus, it graphs the expected and current delay time added by traffic congestion against time of the day. 

Google Maps API: Historical vs. Predictive Congestion Time
Historical Data:
Google Maps API does not provide direct access to historical traffic data. To obtain historical trends, youâ€™d need to build your own dataset by periodically querying the API and storing the results over time. Not viable for user-facing app but good for regression insights.
Predictive Data:
The Directions API can offer predictive travel times if you supply a future departure time. By using parameters like departure_time (set to a future time) along with the traffic_model (e.g., "best_guess", "optimistic", "pessimistic"), you can get an estimate of congestion-based delays.
